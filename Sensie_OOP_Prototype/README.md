# SNAPP The Robotic Fish - OOP Prototype

## Overview
This is the newer, more organized version of the original code, sectioned off into header files. It does the same thing (probably with the same if not faster runtime), but making the code a LOT more digestable and easy to read.

The code is divided into five parts:
- The main .c file which serves as the driver code
- The _**Motor.h**_ which contains the code and math to drive the motor.
- The ___Fins.h___, which contains the code and math to drive the servos within the fins.
- The ___Power.h___, which contains the code to handle the power equipment.
- The ___Sensie.h___, which contains code to handle the smart sensing equipment.
